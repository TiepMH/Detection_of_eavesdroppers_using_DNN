Each part can be independently executed; however, a perfect program is the concatenation of all parts.

The whole program looks like this:
- Part 1: Lines of code for generating raw data and saving the raw data.
      
- Part 2: Lines of code for extracting useful information from the data and saving the useful data.
      
- Part 3: Lines of code for training a DNN with the useful data and saving the trained model.
      
- Part 4: Lines of code for loading the trained model and detecting anomalies.

Important object-oriented classes and functions are in the "library" folder.
